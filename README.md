Overview of the project
Project: Basic Calculator

Objective

The objective of the Basic Calculator Program is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for basic arithmetic operations. It aims to create a user-friendly interface with basic error handling for scenarios like division by zero. Additionally, it serves as an educational tool for beginners to learn Python programming concepts.

Key Activities

User Input: Prompting users to enter two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Operation Selection: Handling user input to select and perform the desired arithmetic operation using conditional statements.
Calculation Execution: Executing the chosen arithmetic operation on the input numbers and handling any potential errors, such as division by zero.
Result Display: Displaying the result of the arithmetic operation to the user in a clear and concise manner.

Technologies Used in the Basic Calculator Program

1.	Python Programming Language: The program is written in Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language widely used for various applications.
2.	Standard Input/Output: The program uses standard input functions (input()) to get user inputs and standard output functions (print()) to display results.
3.	Conditional Statements: The program utilizes if, elif, and else conditional statements to determine and execute the appropriate arithmetic operation based on user input.
4.	Arithmetic Operations: Basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) are performed.
These technologies and concepts form the core of the basic calculator program, enabling it to perform simple arithmetic calculations efficiently.
